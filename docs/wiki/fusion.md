Sitekick Remastered has a feature dubbed "Fusion" which allows players to "Fuse" multiple chips to create a different chip.  Announcements are made via Discord when new Fusion recipes are added to the game, but it is up to the players to discover the recipe.

The Fusion menu can be found in the left-side menu, and can accept a fusion recipe of up to 4 chips.

The chips available for Fusion, and any discovered recipe are found below.
