WOAH! Updates? Here? Happy Soon™️ day!

**Version 0.6.0 is here.**<br>
<!-- more -->
Version 0.6.0 is our largest update to date. With this version, we enter an open beta. All players can register without submitting an application. The game is in a stable enough state to be public.

**NOTE:** Sitekick Remastered is still in Beta. All chips, xp, and collection lists will be wiped upon the full release.

**What's new:**<br>
- 600+ new chips<br>
- The Chipendium now logs every chip you pick up<br>
- You can now trade between players<br>
- Password resets now function<br>
- Account verification emails now function<br>
- 10 new slots (see bugs)<br>

**Major changes:**<br>
Playing via a web browser is no longer supported. The only supported platforms currently are Android and Windows.

**Known bugs:**<br>
- All equipped chips were moved to player inventories (+10 slots)<br>
- Dumping a chip up for trade doesn't cancel the offer (it can not be accepted)<br>
- Some players might need to re-launch the game to see new trade offers<br>
